# Data Structures Course

## Overview

This course is designed to provide a strong foundation in data structures. You will learn how to organize, manage, and store data efficiently using various structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

### Key Topics:
- **Introduction to Data Structures**
  - Understanding the need for efficient data organization
- **Arrays**
  - Static vs. Dynamic arrays
- **Linked Lists**
  - Single, Double, and Circular Linked Lists
- **Stacks & Queues**
  - Stack (LIFO), Queue (FIFO) concepts, and applications
- **Trees**
  - Binary Trees, AVL Trees, B-Trees
- **Graphs**
  - Graph representation, BFS, DFS
- **Hash Tables**
  - Hash functions and collision handling techniques

### Prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of programming (any language is fine)
- Familiarity with algorithms will be helpful but not mandatory

### Learning Outcomes:
- Understand the fundamental data structures and their real-world applications
- Learn to implement and manipulate these structures in code
- Analyze the time and space complexity of different operations
- Choose the right data structure based on problem constraints

### Course Structure:
The course will consist of lectures, code demonstrations, and hands-on exercises. Each topic will be accompanied by practice problems to strengthen your understanding.
